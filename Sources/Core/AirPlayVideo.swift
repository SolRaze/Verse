/// The route that puts video on the CarPlay screen — iOS 26's "AirPlay video in the car".
///
/// This is the ONE place AVPlayer is allowed in this project. AirPlay video works by streaming
/// the media to the receiver, which only AVPlayer's external-playback pipeline can do; VLC
/// decodes and draws locally, so it can never AirPlay video. The split:
///
///   - AVPlayer-compatible container (mp4/m4v/mov/HLS — includes every extracted YouTube
///     stream) -> this player, so "send to car screen" is available.
///   - everything else (mkv/avi/webm/...) -> the VLC `Player`, phone screen only.
///
/// Constraints that are the car's, not ours: the vehicle must support AirPlay video in the car
/// (an MFi feature; factory support is still nearly nonexistent), and playback stops when the
/// car moves. Both enforced by the system — no code here.
